This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## What is this project?

This project is a demo for a website that your standard coffee shop would use. It doesn't aim to be overly flashy, but instead is made to be easy to use and navigate. The header consists of navigation links that you can click in order to quickly find what you are looking for when on the website. The website has videos showcasing some of the methods we use to make our coffee, as well as information about our products, where you can find us, and contact us. You can also make a reservation using the form.

## Plan on improving the project

- It would be good to add a little interactive game or puzzle somewhere in the website, to differentiate us from our competitors, and to help boost engagement (plus, it would be fun).

- Create a section explaining the origins/backstory of our coffee shop business.

- Actually get those links in the footer working.
